# Welcome to client-vendor-app!
Considering you have an application and you have the two types of user; the Client and
the Vendor and Client wants to Request something from the Vendor which is catered
by the app. There is a “waiting time of 5 seconds” before the Vendor receives the
Request (a confirmed Request).
○ Entities:
i. Client
ii. Vendor
○ Note: Consider Request to be like a service like being served.
